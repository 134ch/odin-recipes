# odin-recipes
this is my project building a website following The Odin Project fundamental course

By the end of this project, it is desired that I learned how to make a website page using HTML, and how to make changes log using Git.
It is projected to finish lesser than 2 days.
It starts now (5th June 2023, 00:40 GMT+7)
